        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m a data scientist with a strong foundation in business strategy, specializing in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive operational efficiency and informed decision-making. With expertise in natural language processing, machine learning, and predictive modeling, I build tools and workflows that help organizations make smarter, faster decisions.</p>
        <p>My background includes experience in analytics instruction, technical support, and applied consulting, delivering measurable results across industries. I’m skilled in Python, RStudio, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI, and I thrive at the intersection of technical rigor and business impact.</p>
        <p>I’m especially passionate about making data accessible and turning raw inputs into clear narratives that empower teams. Outside of work, you’ll find me playing the piano, running trails, practicing yoga, or watching international films.</p>

    <section class="bottom-section about-me">
      <h2>Core Values and Principles</h2>
      <p><strong>Accuracy as a Foundation:</strong> Accuracy is about understanding the underlying relationships between the numbers. I prioritize rigorous validation and data governance because good insights come from good data.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Transparency and Integrity:</strong> I practice honest reporting with no p-hacking or cherry-picking. Transparency means sharing what was cleaned, kept, or discarded, and acknowledging data limitations.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Purposeful Questioning:</strong> I start with the right questions in mind to avoid collecting meaningless data, remembering Mark Twain’s caution: <em>“Data is like garbage. You’d better know what you are going to do with it before you collect it.”</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Context Matters Deeply:</strong> Data can mislead without proper context. Data doesn’t lie, but it doesn’t tell the truth either — it’s our job to find the real story.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Analytical Patience and Exploration:</strong> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is critical. Slowing down to understand data deeply improves analysis and impact.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making:</strong> I believe, as W. Edwards Deming said, <em>"Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion."</em> Data grounds decisions beyond gut feeling, revealing hidden inefficiencies and guiding better outcomes.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Educational Impact:</strong> As an instructor, I emphasize clarity and communication, helping others appreciate the importance of accuracy and transparency.</p>
